# Loli loli, and loli!!!

## Description

Yen-Jen loves lolis very much!

Now, there are $N$ cute lolis standing in a line, the $i^{th}$ loli's beauty value is $a_i$.

There are $Q$ events happening in chronological order. There are two types of events: modify and query. 

In modify event, Yen-Jen thinks that the $x^{th}$ loli's value is not good. He thinks that $a_x$ should be $y$ instead.

In query event, Yen-Jen will pick up two continuous segments $[L, R]$ and $[l, r]$, and count the pair of lolis whose beauty value is the same. Formally speaking, Yen-Jen will count the pair $(i, j)$, such that $L \le i \le R, l \le j \le r$, and $a_i = a_j$.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two integers $N, Q$, which denotes the number of lolis, and the number of events.

In the next line, there are $N$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N$. $a_i$ denotes the beauty value of the $i^{th}$ loli initially.

Then, there are the description of the $Q$ events, each events occupy a line.

The line starts with an integer $t$ denotes the type of event. If $t = 1$, then it is an modify event, two integers $x, y$ will come after $t$. If $t = 2$, then it is an query event, four integers $L, R, l, r$ will come later. The definition of the parameters are mentioned above!

* $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
* $1 \le a_i \le 10^5$
* $1 \le l \le r \le N, 1 \le L \le R \le N$
* $1 \le x \le N$
* $1 \le y \le 10^5$

### Output

For each query, output the corresponding number of pairs.
