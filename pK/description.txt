# K-rectangle

## Description

There are n points on the plane, ($x_1, y_1$),($x_2,y_2$)â€¦($x_n,y_n$), $x_i< x_{i+1}$,$0< y_i$

You need to place several rectangles to cover all of them with the follow constraints.

(a point is covered if it lies inside the rectangle or on the side of the rectangle)

1. The bottom side of the rectangle should be $y = 0$
2. The cost of a rectangle is $h\times(w + k)$
3. Any two different rectangle can't have intersection
4. the rectangle can degenerate to two lines which means $w = 0$ 

 Please calculate the minimum cost to cover all of the points

## Input

The first line contains two integers,

$n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le2\times10^5, 1\le k \le 10^6$) ---

the number of vertices and the coefficient described in the problem.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers,

 $x_i$ and $y_i$($-10^6 \le x_i \le 10^6, 1\le y_i \le 10^6$)---
meaning $i^{th}$ point is at ($x_i$ ,$y_i$).

## Output

The minimum cost that satisfied the problem.
