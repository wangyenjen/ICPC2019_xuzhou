How many different breeds of cats
============

Today, you came to a cat village. There are $N$ cats in this village. 
Each cat is very cute, and all the $N$ cats are very cleverly lined up in a row.

As we all know, there are $B$ breeds of cats in the world.
Breed of each cat from left to right in this village is $a_1, a_2, ..., a_N$.

Because you are a coder and cat lover who is very interested in cat breeds, 
you may be curious about the following type of question: 
given $K$ intervals, $[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_K, r_K]$, 
how many different breeds of cats which appear a positive even number times in the union (that is, if a cat appears in multiple intervals, it should be counted only once) of the $K$ intervals?

Now, give you $M$ such questions, can you answer all correctly?

Input
-----
The first line contains three positive integers
$N$, $B$ and $M$ ($1\leq N, B, M\leq 10^ 5$) --- the number of cats in this village, 
the number of breeds of cats in the world and the number of questions you need to answer.

The second line contains $N$ positive integers $a_1, a_2,\cdots, a_{N}$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq B$).

The following $M$ lines contain questions, one per line.
The first integer in the line is $K$ ($1 \leq K \leq 10^5$), followed by $2\times K$ integers
$l_1, r_1, l_2, r_2, \cdots, l_K, r_K$ ($1 \leq l_i, r_i \leq N$) in the same line.

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $K$'s is not greater than $10^5$.

Output
-----
Print $M$ lines. The $i$-th line contains one integer ---
the number of breeds of cats which appear a positive even number times in the given intervals.
