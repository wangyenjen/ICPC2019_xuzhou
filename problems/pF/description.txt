The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.

# Description

For decades, scientists have wondered whether each of the numbers from 0 to 100 
could be represented as the sum of three cubes, where a cube is the same number multiplied together three times.

42 was the last number without a proven solution â€” until now.

The solution is 
$(-80538738812075974)^3 + 80435758145817515^3 + 12602123297335631^3 = 42$

Now, Eddy is suspicious of the existence of other solutions. 
But, the solutions are not so trivial to find out. Eddy wants to find out easy
solutions first. That is, for the equation $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = x$,
Eddy wants to find out at least one solution for each integer $x$ in $[0, 200]$,
where $|a|, |b|, |c| \le 5000$.

Since Eddy is still busy preparing the test data of some(this?) problem, please
help him find out at least one solution for each $x$ or tell him that the
solution doesn't exist when $|a|, |b|, |c| \le 5000$.

# Input

The first line contains an integer $T$ indicating the number of $x$ to be
checked.
Following $T$$ lines each contains one integer $x$.

* $1 \le T \le 10$
* $0 \le x \le 200$

# Output

For each test case, output one line containing three space-separated integers 
$a, b, c$ such that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = x$ and $|a|, |b|, |c| \le 5000$. If the
solution doesn't exist, output $\texttt{"impossible"}$.
