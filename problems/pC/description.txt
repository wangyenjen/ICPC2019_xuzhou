# <3 numbers

## Description
Rosie likes to play with positive integers, especially the <3 numbers in positive integers.

<3 number is a special group of positive integers, 
all of which can be divided into less than three positive integers.

For example, $7$ is a < 3 number. There are two positive integers that divide $7$ by $1$ and $7$. 
$25$ is not a number less than $3$. There are $1$, $5$ and $25$ that can divide $25$.

Now, Rosie is curious about how many <3 numbers are included between positive integers $L$ and $R$. 
But it's too difficult to figure out exactly how many <3 numbers there are. 
Rosie wants to know whether the proportion of <3 numbers between $L$ and $R$ is less than one third. 
To be exact, if there are $x$ <3 numbers between $L$ and $R$, Rosie wants to know if $\frac{x}{R-L+1} < \frac{1}{3}$.

Please help the curious Rosie to answer his questions.


## Input
The first line has a positive integer of $T$, which represents the total number of test data.

Each test data is a line of two integers $L, R $.

* $1 \le T \le 100$
* $1 \le L \le R \le 10^9$

## Output

Please output one line for each test data. 
If the proportion of <3 numbers between $L $and $R$ is less than one third, 
output $\texttt{"Yes"}$, otherwise output $\texttt{"No"}$ (without double quotes)

### Sample Input

```
3
7 7
25 25
5 14
```

### Sample Output

```
No
Yes
No
```
