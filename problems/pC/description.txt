# Loli Tree

## Description

Yen-Jen loves Loli very much!

Now, by his investigation, he found that there are $N$ cities (cities are numbered from $1$ to $N$) in his favorite loli country.

In the loli country, there are $N - 1$ two-way roads to connect the $N$ cities such that every country can go to every other country by one or more roads.

In every road, there's a color assigned to it.

Now, Yen-Jen is interesing in the structure of the city. He will send $Q$ lolis to investigate this country. He will ask the $i^{th}$ loli to city $A_i$, and ask her to go to city $B_i$. The lolis are so smart that they will only go the shortest path to the destination! And when the lolis is going on the road, they will collect the colors that they walk.

And, after the $i^{th}$ investigation, Yen-Jen is interesting that, how many pair $(x, y)$, such that both color $x, y$ appear at least once, and the appearance of color $x$ is twice the appearance of color $y$.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two integers $N, Q$, the number of cities in loli country, and the number of investigations Yen-Jen want to do.

In the next $N - 1$ lines, the $i^{th}$ line contain three integers $u_i, v_i, c_i$, which means the $i^{th}$ edge connect city $u_i$ and $v_i$, and its color is $c_i$.

In the next $Q$ lines, the $i^{th}$ line contains two integers $A_i, B_i$, which means Yen-Jen wants to send a loli to city $A_i$, and the loli is going to city $B_i$.

* $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
* $1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$
* $1 \le c_i \le 10^5$
* $1 \le A_i, B_i \le n$

## Output

For each investigation, output the corresponding answer mentioned in the problem description.
