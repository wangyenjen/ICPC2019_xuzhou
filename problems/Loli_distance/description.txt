# Loli distance

## Description

Yen-Jen loves loli so much!

Yen-Jen define the so-called loli distance of two integer sequences $S$ and $T$ as follows:
 
* if the length of two sequences is not the same, then the loli distance of $S$ and $T$ is $10^{100}$
* Otherwise, the loli distance between $S$ and $T$ is the number of positions at which the corresponding integers are different.

Now, Yen-Jen has $N$ integer sequence which is selected by his best friend: little cute cat!

But now, little cute cat wants to challenge Yen-Jen with $Q$ questions, in each question, little cute cat will come up with an integer sequence $T$, and she wants Yen-Jen to answer the number of sequences $S$ he has, such that the loli distnace of $S$ and $T$ is not greater then 2.
 
## Input

The first line of the input contains one integer $N$ denotes the number of integer sequences that Yen-Jen has.

In the next $N$ line, each line contains an integer sequence. The first integer of each line $L$ denotes the length of the integer sequence. Then, the next $L$ integers are the elements in the integer sequence.

Then, the line contains one integer $Q$ denotes the number of questions that little cute cat wants to challenge.

In the next $Q$ line, each line contains an integer sequence. The first integer of each line $L$ denotes the length of the integer sequence. Then, the next $L$ integers are the elements in the integer sequence.

* $1 \le N, Q \le 10^5$
* $1 \le$ the elements in integer sequence $\le 10^9$
* It it guarantee that the total length of integer sequences of Yen-Jen and little cute cat is not greater than $10^5$.

### Output

For each question that little cute cat challenge Yen-Jen, output the corresponding answer.
