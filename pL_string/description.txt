# Loli, Yen-Jen, and a cool problem

## Description

Yen-Jen loves loli very much!!!

Now, he is solving a problem with a cute, cat-eared loli. But he drinks too much yesterday and his mind is not open yet, so he asked you to solve the following problem for him!

Given a rooted tree with $N$ vertices(vertices are numbered from $1$ to $N$) whose root is $1$. In every node, there's an uppercase letter on it.

Define one way to generate a string with len $L$ as follows:

* select a start node $X$
* go to the parent node $L - 1$ times
* whenever goes to a node, append the corresponding English letter to the end of the string

Now there are $Q$ queries, in the $i^{th}$ query, a start node $X_i$ is given. Please count the number of starting node $Y$(include $X_i$), such that $Y$ can generate the same string as $X_i$.

## Input

The first line of the input contains two integer $N, Q$ which is mentioned above.

In the next line, a string $S$ is given, the $i^{th}$ character means the English letter on the $i^{th}$ node.

Then, there are $N - 1$ integers in one line, the $i^{th}$ integer is the parent of node $i + 1$.

Then, there are $Q$ lines, the $i^{th}$ line repretens the $i^{th}$ query. In each line, $X_i, L_i$ is given, which is mentioned in the description.

It is guaranteed that the testcase is valid!

* $1 \leq N, Q \leq 3 \times 10 ^ 5$
* $1 \leq X_i, L_i  \leq N$

### Output

Output $Q$ lines, the $i^{th}$ represents the ansewr of the $i^{th}$ query.
